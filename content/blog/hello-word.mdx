# Hey friends 👋

Just dropping by to share a little something I've been playing with lately. Been diving into some JavaScript utilities and wanted to put together a simple snippet that returns a greeting with a bit of a twist. Nothing groundbreaking, but sometimes clean and simple is all you need.

### Here's the code:

```jsx
const greetUser = (name = "World") => {
  const message = `Hello, ${name}! 👋`;
  return message;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(greetUser()); // "Hello, World! 👋"
console.log(greetUser("Dev")); // "Hello, Dev! 👋"
```
